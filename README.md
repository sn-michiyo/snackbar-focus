# snackbar-focus

Snackbar actions are not accessible with talkback on. 


When a snackbar is shown, the user is told about the button but unable to activate it.  Example:

They are able to activate the action if they move focus to it, but they have to know to navigate there and need to get there before the snackbar is dismissed.  Example:
